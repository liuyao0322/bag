# Triton BAG GEMM Optimization Log

## Summary

| Version | Direction | Signal result | Correct | Decision |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| baseline | Current grouped tiled `tl.dot` kernel | 2.185636 ms geomean; 0.365529x vs unfused | yes | baseline |

## Baseline

- Direction: Current implementation before GEMM-body optimization.
- Hypothesis: Column-major operands are mapped poorly for Triton's preferred
  row-major dot operand layouts; fixed shape buckets also leave throughput on
  the table.
- Result: fused geomean 2.185636 ms and speedup geomean 0.365529x on the
  six-shape column-major IEEE signal set. Individual fused medians were
  0.5796/2.1089/12.9966 ms for square 1024/2048/4096, 1.9471 ms tall,
  2.0449 ms wide, and 1.7234 ms large-K. `CORRECT=True`.
- Analysis: The baseline is 2.74x slower than the preallocated unfused path by
  geometric mean. Prior row-major measurements were materially faster, making
  physical-layout reinterpretation the highest-confidence first direction.
